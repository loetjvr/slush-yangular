==============

> A [slush](http://slushjs.github.io) generator for AngularJS using Bootstrap and Less based on the AngularJS generator for Yeoman.

## Installation

Install `slush-yangular` globally:

```bash
npm install -g slush-yangular
```

Remember to install `slush` globally as well, if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g slush
```

## Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-angular-app
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:
*Note name is optional*

```bash
cd my-angular-app
slush yangular name
```

#### Tasks

To generate additional scripts and files. *Based on the AngularJS generator for Yeoman*:

```bash
slush yangular:view name
```

```bash
slush yangular:controller name
```

```bash
slush yangular:route name
```

```bash
slush yangular:directive name
```

```bash
slush yangular:filter name
```

```bash
slush yangular:service name
```

```bash
slush yangular:factory name
```

```bash
slush yangular:constant name
```

### Gulpfile

*The gulpfile is based on the gulp-webapp generator for Yeoman*

#### Development

To start developing in your new generated project run:
*Note --open is optional. This argument opens the browser*

```bash
gulp serve --open
```

Then head to `http://localhost:9000` in your browser.

The `serve` task starts a static file server, which serves your AngularJS application, and a watch task which watches your files for changes and lints, builds and injects them into your index.html accordingly.


#### Testing

To run Karma tests:

```bash
gulp test
```

#### Production ready build

To make the app ready for deploy to production run:

```bash
gulp build
```

Now you have a `./dist` folder with all your scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.

#### Documentation

To generate [ngDocs](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Writing-AngularJS-Documentation):

```bash
gulp docs
```

Now you have a `./docs` folder with all the generated documentation in a format that can be hosted.
